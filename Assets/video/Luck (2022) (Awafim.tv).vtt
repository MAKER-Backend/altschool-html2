Did they reschedule?

00:10:31.715 --> 00:10:37.095
No, but there's a couple who wants to come
for a first visit on Sunday afternoon.

Hey, you.

They're not coming.

I know. I'm so sorry, Hazel.

00:10:55.364 --> 00:10:57.908
What if I never find a forever family?

00:10:58.534 --> 00:11:00.577
This was just a little bad luck.

00:11:00.661 --> 00:11:01.828
Of course you will.

00:11:01.912 --> 00:11:03.830
You didn't.

00:11:04.957 --> 00:11:08.085
Yeah, but you're not me.

00:11:08.168 --> 00:11:10.671
You're the lucky leprechaun, remember?

00:11:11.338 --> 00:11:15.592
You always find the pot of gold,
and this will be no different.

00:11:15.676 --> 00:11:17.761
You'll find your forever family too.

00:11:18.262 --> 00:11:19.638
Who knows?

00:11:19.721 --> 00:11:22.057
Maybe the couple coming on Sunday.

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:23.433
Maybe it'll be them.

00:11:24.017 --> 00:11:26.186
Yeah, maybe.

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:29.439
And maybe you'll find me
a lucky penny before then.

Why couldn't it have just worked out?

00:12:35.005 --> 00:12:37.549
Oh, sorry,
I didn't tell you the first part.

00:12:38.342 --> 00:12:42.971
My friend Hazel could have been
one step closer to getting adopted today,

00:12:43.555 --> 00:12:45.140
but it didn't happen.

00:12:45.224 --> 00:12:46.808
Her weekend visit got canceled,

00:12:48.227 --> 00:12:51.396
which probably doesn't sound
like a big deal,

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:53.232
but believe me, it is.

00:12:54.358 --> 00:12:58.070
You only get so many chances
to find a forever family,

00:12:58.153 --> 00:13:00.614
and the older you get, the harder it is.

00:13:01.615 --> 00:13:03.909
She's meeting a new couple on Sunday.

00:13:03.992 --> 00:13:06.912
If I could just give her
a little good luck…

00:13:07.704 --> 00:13:10.832
But you can't give someone
something you've never had.

00:13:11.959 --> 00:13:13.836
Still, if I could,

00:13:14.837 --> 00:13:18.298
and if good luck was something
you could actually hold in your hand,

00:13:18.382 --> 00:13:20.217
I'd give it all to Hazel.

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:22.719
So that maybe she could find
her forever family

00:13:22.803 --> 00:13:25.764

00:15:18.961 --> 00:15:20.087
[chuckles]

00:15:30.597 --> 00:15:31.974
[gasps, exclaims]

00:15:38.188 --> 00:15:40.148
Lucky pennies are real.

00:15:42.025 --> 00:15:45.279
Ms. Rivera, hi.
Is it okay if I stop by after work later?

00:15:45.362 --> 00:15:48.365
I have something special
for Hazel for her visit tomorrow.

00:15:48.448 --> 00:15:49.449
Oh, great.

00:15:49.533 --> 00:15:52.411
Oh, and please don't tell her.
I want it to be a surprise.

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:55.247
Whoo-hoo!

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:58.500
Yes! Yes. Yes, yes, yes!

00:16:01.378 --> 00:16:03.172
Winner, winner, chicken dinner.

00:16:03.755 --> 00:16:04.882
Boom.

00:16:06.884 --> 00:16:08.177
Hi, Marv.

00:16:13.557 --> 00:16:14.558
Whoa!

00:16:23.984 --> 00:16:26.820
-Well, somebody found their groove.
-[both laugh]

00:16:26.904 --> 00:16:28.697
No cart patrol for you tomorrow.

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:31.158
I got a pallet of glassware
with your name on it.

00:16:31.241 --> 00:16:33.118
-Sounds great.
-Have a nice night.

00:16:33.202 --> 00:16:36.622
Thanks. I will.
I'm off to surprise my friend Hazel.

00:16:50.302 --> 00:16:52.346
-[beeps, flushes]
-[gasps]

00:16:52.429 --> 00:16:53.889
-[gasps]
-[coin plops]

00:16:54.556 --> 00:16:55.557
[grunts]

00:17:07.319 --> 00:17:08.319
[exhales sharply]

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:22.876
[grunting]

00:17:25.087 --> 00:17:26.213
[whimpers]

00:17:31.468 --> 00:17:32.553
[gasps]

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:37.516
[beeps, flushes]

00:17:39.309 --> 00:17:43.730
[grunts] My stupid bad luck.

00:17:43.814 --> 00:17:45.023
[groans]

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:47.943
You're back.

00:17:48.026 --> 00:17:52.906
[sighs] So, remember I told you
I wanted good luck for my friend Hazel

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:54.241
for her visit tomorrow?

00:17:54.324 --> 00:17:55.659
Well, guess what?

00:17:55.742 --> 00:17:58.579
After you left last night, I found some.

00:17:58.662 --> 00:18:02.791
That's right.
I found an actual lucky penny.

00:18:02.875 --> 00:18:05.711
And what did I do?
I flushed it down the toilet.

00:18:05.794 --> 00:18:07.212
You did what?

00:18:07.296 --> 00:18:09.590
You flushed my penny down the toilet?

00:18:09.673 --> 00:18:11.508
What did you do that for?

00:18:12.342 --> 00:18:14.553
You just talked.

00:18:14.636 --> 00:18:15.846
[gasps]

00:18:16.805 --> 00:18:18.182
[gasps]

00:18:19.183 --> 00:18:20.809
It was you.

00:18:21.852 --> 00:18:23.937
You gave me that lucky penny.

00:18:24.688 --> 00:18:27.191
Please, I just need one more.

00:18:27.274 --> 00:18:28.650
Wait!

00:18:28.734 --> 00:18:30.652
Wait! Come back!

00:18:30.736 --> 00:18:32.404
-[bell rings]
-Whoa!

00:18:37.951 --> 00:18:39.203
[bulb horn honks]

00:18:59.681 --> 00:19:00.682
[groans]

00:19:04.645 --> 00:19:06.438
[grunting]

00:19:10.692 --> 00:19:11.610
[exclaims]

00:19:13.487 --> 00:19:14.446
[grunts]

00:19:21.078 --> 00:19:21.912
Whoa!

00:19:25.707 --> 00:19:26.917
[grunts] Whoa!

00:19:31.213 --> 00:19:32.840
[pants] Huh?

00:20:07.416 --> 00:20:10.377
I just need a penny for my friend Hazel.

00:20:12.129 --> 00:20:14.548
[grunting]

00:20:15.883 --> 00:20:16.884
[grunts]

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:20.971
[grunts]

00:20:26.185 --> 00:20:27.769
Huh?

00:20:38.071 --> 00:20:39.072
[grunts]

00:20:40.199 --> 00:20:41.200
[shouts]

00:20:42.201 --> 00:20:43.202
[grunts]

00:20:55.339 --> 00:20:56.882
[grunts, sighs]

00:20:58.634 --> 00:20:59.635
[sighs]

00:21:00.594 --> 00:21:04.056
[cat] How was my day? Oh, it was lovely!
Thank you. Just brilliant.

00:21:04.139 --> 00:21:06.642
Lost my travel penny
and was chased across the city

00:21:06.725 --> 00:21:09.061
by an unrelenting human zombie.

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:13.232
Ugh.
Always with the obnoxiously long password.

00:21:13.315 --> 00:21:15.400
-[thrums, whirs]
-Oh, got it.

00:21:27.579 --> 00:21:28.622
[gasps]

00:21:29.706 --> 00:21:30.749
[shouts]

00:21:34.545 --> 00:21:36.171
[shouts]

00:21:46.223 --> 00:21:49.560
Now, about that penny problem.
Why you talking to yourself, Bob?

00:21:49.643 --> 00:21:53.063
Oh, just practicing so when I'm banished
forever, I'll have someone to talk to--

00:21:53.146 --> 00:21:55.148
-[yelps, grunting]
-[screams]

00:21:55.232 --> 00:21:56.942
No, no, no, no.

00:21:57.025 --> 00:21:58.110
[grunting]

00:21:58.193 --> 00:22:01.697
[screams]
What manner of crazy human are you?

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:04.283
What kind of a crazy talking cat are you?

00:22:04.366 --> 00:22:06.076
A lucky Scottish one, obviously.

00:22:06.159 --> 00:22:07.870
But black cats aren't lucky.

00:22:07.953 --> 00:22:11.999
Ha! In Scotland, black cats are considered
very lucky, thank you very much.

00:22:12.082 --> 00:22:13.750
-Is this Scotland?
-No!

00:22:13.834 --> 00:22:16.420
And humans cannot be here.

00:22:16.503 --> 00:22:19.423
-Where's "here"?
-You need to leave. Now.

00:22:20.007 --> 00:22:21.884
Oh, I'll leave, no problem,

00:22:21.967 --> 00:22:24.094
as soon as you give me
another lucky penny.

00:22:24.178 --> 00:22:26.346
I did not give you a penny.

00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:31.018
It fell out of my collar when you lured me
over with that tasty meat bread.

00:22:31.101 --> 00:22:32.561
It's called a panini.

00:22:32.644 --> 00:22:36.523
Whatever. It was all just a ploy
to steal my travel penny.

00:22:36.607 --> 00:22:37.608
Travel penny?

00:22:37.691 --> 00:22:40.652
We creatures from the Land of Luck
aren't lucky in your world,

00:22:40.736 --> 00:22:42.654
so we carry some with us just to be safe.

00:22:42.738 --> 00:22:45.407
Did you just say, "Land of Luck"?

00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:47.659
-[voices speak indistinctly]
-[yelps] Hide, hide, hide!

00:22:50.162 --> 00:22:52.414
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

00:22:52.497 --> 00:22:55.834
Welcome back, Bob. Arrived back
18 hundred hours and six minutes.

00:22:55.918 --> 00:22:57.628
Leprechauns?

00:22:57.711 --> 00:22:59.755
Anything unusual happen on the other side?

00:22:59.838 --> 00:23:01.507
-[device whirs]
-Nope.

00:23:03.008 --> 00:23:06.094
[device beeping]

00:23:06.178 --> 00:23:09.139
[leprechaun 1] Oh, I see you located
one blocked luck line.

00:23:09.223 --> 00:23:10.974
That construction site. No wonder.

00:23:11.058 --> 00:23:15.187
Yep, looks like Paulie's popcorn pop-up
is putting down roots.

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:18.815
[chuckles] Not a problem.
Two ticks and around she goes.

00:23:18.899 --> 00:23:21.360
[leprechaun 1]
I'd wager three might do the trick.

00:23:22.486 --> 00:23:24.780
[leprechaun 2, chuckles]
Right you are, Quinn.

00:23:24.863 --> 00:23:27.115
Luck flowing freely once again.

00:23:27.199 --> 00:23:30.994
Say, you guys seen Gerry around?
He's usually here to check me in.

00:23:31.078 --> 00:23:34.331
Oh, he's down at the Penny Depot.
They needed an extra hand.

00:23:34.414 --> 00:23:35.415
Penny Depot?

00:23:35.499 --> 00:23:37.334
[Quinn]
So we're covering his line cat returns.

00:23:37.417 --> 00:23:41.421
Oh, and Gerry said he always turns in
your travel penny for ya,

00:23:41.505 --> 00:23:43.048
so we'll be taking that now.

00:23:43.131 --> 00:23:44.383
Uh-oh.

00:23:44.466 --> 00:23:47.719
You know what,
I'll just turn it in myself today.

00:23:47.803 --> 00:23:50.305
Uh, if you say so, Bob.
Good luck with that.

00:23:50.389 --> 00:23:54.393
Yeah. Say hi to the Captain for us.
We know how much she loves you.

00:23:54.476 --> 00:23:55.853
But she doesn't love him.

00:23:55.936 --> 00:23:57.896
-[Quinn] I was being ironical.
-You're so clever.

00:23:57.980 --> 00:23:59.189
What have I done?

00:23:59.273 --> 00:24:01.275
I wasn't supposed to stop
and eat human food.

00:24:01.358 --> 00:24:03.735
I definitely wasn't supposed to talk
in front of a human.

00:24:03.819 --> 00:24:07.573
And I sure as heck wasn't supposed to let
the human who lost my travel penny

00:24:07.656 --> 00:24:09.283
follow me through the portal!

00:24:09.366 --> 00:24:13.620
Okay, but those leprechauns just said
something about a Penny Depot.

00:24:13.704 --> 00:24:15.038
Maybe we could get one there.

00:24:15.122 --> 00:24:19.418
Only leprechauns are allowed inside,
and you are not a leprechaun!

00:24:20.002 --> 00:24:21.503
But maybe I could be.

00:24:21.587 --> 00:24:22.588
[laughs] What?

00:24:22.671 --> 00:24:25.632
You think you're just gonna march
down to the leprechaun locker room

00:24:25.716 --> 00:24:27.384
and-- and-- and borrow some clothes?

00:24:27.467 --> 00:24:30.262
-Brilliant idea. Let's go.
-No, wait. Stop!

00:24:30.846 --> 00:24:31.972
Just stop!

00:24:32.055 --> 00:24:35.100
Hey, Bob. Everything okay?

00:24:35.184 --> 00:24:38.562
Aye, just, uh, stretching my legs.
[grunts]

00:24:38.645 --> 00:24:39.730
Okeydokey.

00:24:39.813 --> 00:24:41.064
[grunts]

00:24:41.148 --> 00:24:45.527
Even if you could masquerade as
some freakishly big leprechaun,

00:24:45.611 --> 00:24:48.906
I can't get past the Captain
without turning in a penny.

00:24:48.989 --> 00:24:51.366
What if you turned in this?

00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:53.744
This is a button.

00:24:53.827 --> 00:24:56.205
And at some point, they will discover it,

00:24:56.288 --> 00:25:00.959
and if I don't have a lucky penny in hand
when they do, I'll be banished.

00:25:01.043 --> 00:25:04.963
Okay,
but maybe the button buys us a little time

00:25:05.047 --> 00:25:07.466
until we get a lucky penny
from the Penny Depot.

00:25:07.549 --> 00:25:10.093
-Then I'll borrow it for my frie--
-For your friend Hazel.

00:25:10.177 --> 00:25:11.887
Yes, I've got that part.

00:25:12.554 --> 00:25:15.182
What? You said it, like, a hundred times.

00:25:15.682 --> 00:25:18.060
We'll go to the Penny Depot
to get one penny.

00:25:18.143 --> 00:25:20.771
I use it first, and then it's all yours.

00:25:22.564 --> 00:25:23.857
And then I'll leave.

00:25:25.484 --> 00:25:27.694
You'll never see my face again.

00:25:30.322 --> 00:25:32.407
Great. I'm Sam, by the way.

00:25:32.491 --> 00:25:35.827
This is strictly business.
Names are unimportant.

00:25:35.911 --> 00:25:38.997
But I already heard them call you Bob.

00:25:39.081 --> 00:25:40.958
Oh, fine. Yes, it's Bob.

00:25:42.417 --> 00:25:46.547
Whoo. Welcome back, line cats.
Now, drop your pennies and move along.

00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:48.298
That's it. Let's go, kitty cats.

00:25:48.382 --> 00:25:49.883
Drop your travel pennies.

00:25:50.634 --> 00:25:51.969
-[coins clinking]
-[beeps]

00:25:52.052 --> 00:25:53.303
Keep it moving.

00:25:53.804 --> 00:25:56.306
Ah, sector 64 today, Joanie.

00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:57.641
Oh, Nigeria.

00:25:58.559 --> 00:26:00.060
[beeping]

00:26:01.353 --> 00:26:03.188
Catch you on the flip side, Cap.

00:26:03.272 --> 00:26:06.483
-That's the Captain?
-Aye, that's her.

00:26:06.567 --> 00:26:08.443
She really doesn't like me.

00:26:08.527 --> 00:26:10.571
Maybe she's not a cat person.

00:26:10.654 --> 00:26:12.781
Well, she likes the other cats just fine.

00:26:13.365 --> 00:26:15.033
So, what's the plan?

00:26:15.117 --> 00:26:18.912
Right. You sneak out that door over there.
I'll keep the Captain busy.

00:26:18.996 --> 00:26:21.915
When you're clear, I'll drop in the button
and meet you on the other side.

00:26:21.999 --> 00:26:24.293
Simple. Good luck to us both.

00:26:27.671 --> 00:26:30.674
Ooh,
the sweet clankety-clack of lucky pennies.

00:26:30.757 --> 00:26:32.843
There's no better sound in the world.

00:26:33.552 --> 00:26:35.929
Bob, what are you waiting for?
Drop your penny.

00:26:36.013 --> 00:26:37.514
Aye, I got it right here, Cap.

00:26:37.598 --> 00:26:39.975
But first, how's your day been so far?

00:26:40.058 --> 00:26:41.685
Okay, Bob, what are you up to?

00:26:41.768 --> 00:26:45.314
[chuckles] Why can't a cat ask
how his boss's day is going?

00:26:45.397 --> 00:26:46.982
Because it's weird, Bob.

00:26:47.065 --> 00:26:50.110
Because you never have asked me
anything, Bob.

00:26:50.194 --> 00:26:52.321
Because we don't even like
each other, Bob.

00:26:52.404 --> 00:26:57.868
Because you give me the heebie-jeebies,
and you always have, Bob.

00:26:57.951 --> 00:27:00.871
Oh, is that all? All righty then.

00:27:01.455 --> 00:27:03.957
Say, Captain, do you like jokes?

00:27:04.708 --> 00:27:06.168
Only the funny ones, Bob.

00:27:06.251 --> 00:27:09.421
[chuckles]
Right. Well, then you'll love this one.

00:27:09.505 --> 00:27:11.256
Why did the penny arrest the nickel?

00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:14.384
I don't know, Bob. Why?

00:27:14.468 --> 00:27:16.553
Because she was a copper.

00:27:17.513 --> 00:27:20.265
[laughs]

00:27:20.349 --> 00:27:22.684
[wheezing, laughing continues]

00:27:22.768 --> 00:27:24.394
[muttering indistinctly]

00:27:24.478 --> 00:27:25.479
Wasn't funny.

00:27:25.562 --> 00:27:27.272
Yeah, not my best.

00:27:27.356 --> 00:27:31.151
-Catch you later, Cap.
-Not if I catch you first, Bob.

00:27:31.235 --> 00:27:33.403
Leprechaun locker room, here we come.

00:27:33.487 --> 00:27:35.614
[Captain]
Welcome back, Shirley. Keep it moving.

00:27:36.406 --> 00:27:38.992
[Sam] Not to pry, but do you have fingers?

00:27:39.076 --> 00:27:41.703
Thumbs. I'm polydactyl.

00:27:44.081 --> 00:27:46.124
"Gerry." That's your friend, right?

00:27:46.208 --> 00:27:48.043
Eh, he's more like my assistant.

00:27:48.126 --> 00:27:49.795
You sure he won't mind?

00:27:49.878 --> 00:27:51.338
[scoffs] Gerry never minds.

00:27:51.421 --> 00:27:53.340
And enough with the questions.

00:27:53.423 --> 00:27:56.718
Strictly business, remember?
We don't need to get to know each other.

00:27:56.802 --> 00:27:58.053
-Yeah, okay.
-[toilet flushes]

00:27:58.136 --> 00:28:00.389
[leprechaun]
Then he says, "Are you a River dancer?"

00:28:00.472 --> 00:28:02.140
[gasps] We forgot to check the lavvy.

00:28:02.224 --> 00:28:03.684
-Hurry, before somebody sees.
-[gasps]

00:28:03.767 --> 00:28:07.229
-And then he did a little jig.
-A jig? No. [gasps] You have to show--

00:28:07.312 --> 00:28:08.939
-Good afternoon, ladies.
-[gasps]

00:28:09.022 --> 00:28:11.233
What are you doing in here, Bob?

00:28:11.316 --> 00:28:14.152
Aye, line cats have their own locker room.

00:28:14.236 --> 00:28:17.656
Oh, I-- I-- I was just, uh--
Well, I was, um--

00:28:17.739 --> 00:28:19.700
-You know--
-[Sam] He was helping me.

00:28:20.784 --> 00:28:24.288
He's my Land of Luck
leprechaun orientation guide.

00:28:25.205 --> 00:28:28.333
-Deary me, you're a big lass.
-Aye.

00:28:29.084 --> 00:28:30.669
I'm Sam.

00:28:30.752 --> 00:28:31.879
Where ya from?

00:28:33.046 --> 00:28:36.884
She, uh-- She's from, uh--
Uh, you know, uh--

00:28:37.551 --> 00:28:40.345
Latvia! That's right. She's from Latvia.

00:28:42.264 --> 00:28:43.265
[giggles]

00:28:44.558 --> 00:28:48.645
Hey, Saoirse, didn't Clodagh say she met
a Latvian guy down at the Hairy Lemon,

00:28:48.729 --> 00:28:50.564
and that he was a real big fella too?

00:28:50.647 --> 00:28:51.899
Aye, she did.

00:28:51.982 --> 00:28:55.986
Well, cheers to Latvia
for growing 'em big. [chuckles]

00:28:56.069 --> 00:29:00.949
Guess not all lucky creatures are
teeny-toaty like us, eh? [laughs, sighs]

00:29:01.658 --> 00:29:03.994
-Nice meeting you.
-Enjoy the rest of your tour.

00:29:04.077 --> 00:29:07.289
-Don't do anything we wouldn't do.
-[leprechaun] Oh, you're shameless.

00:29:07.372 --> 00:29:09.333
They were so sweet and tiny.

00:29:09.416 --> 00:29:12.127
And surprisingly less clever than usual.

00:29:12.211 --> 00:29:13.921
[chuckles] They totally bought it.

00:29:14.004 --> 00:29:15.380
Next stop, lucky penny.

00:29:15.464 --> 00:29:17.424
-Right.
-And then, you leave.

00:29:17.508 --> 00:29:18.800
-[Sam] Right.
-Say it with me.

00:29:18.884 --> 00:29:21.553
-And then you leave.
-No, you leave.

00:29:21.637 --> 00:29:23.805
Yeah, I know. It was a joke.

00:29:28.143 --> 00:29:29.144
[gasps]

00:29:33.148 --> 00:29:34.816
[Bob] Welcome to the Land of Luck.

00:29:37.903 --> 00:29:39.112
[Sam] Incredible.

00:29:45.118 --> 00:29:46.370
Hey, there.

00:29:55.295 --> 00:29:56.338
Uh-huh.

00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:06.390
Morning.

00:30:06.473 --> 00:30:09.643
This way.
We'll be at the Penny Depot in no time.

00:30:09.726 --> 00:30:12.688
-Follow me right onto the disc.
-Okay.

00:30:12.771 --> 00:30:14.398
Here we go.

00:30:14.481 --> 00:30:16.275
Just smile and wave.

00:30:16.775 --> 00:30:19.653
-Hey, Bob. Lunch this week?
-Aye, let's do it.

00:30:20.153 --> 00:30:21.488
Okay, it's transfer time.

00:30:22.823 --> 00:30:26.493
[machine whirring, clinking]

00:30:31.331 --> 00:30:33.208
-Morning, Bob.
-Hi, Betty.

00:30:33.292 --> 00:30:37.296
So far, so good, Sam.
No one's even noticed ya. [chuckles]

00:30:37.379 --> 00:30:39.923
[gasps] Sam? Sam?

00:30:40.424 --> 00:30:41.508
[gasps]

00:30:42.134 --> 00:30:43.135
Sam!

00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:48.182
You hear about Joe?
He just joined the luck makers' union.

00:30:48.265 --> 00:30:50.517
That's great. He's hilarious.

00:30:50.601 --> 00:30:52.019
Whoa. [exclaims]

00:30:52.895 --> 00:30:55.147
[gasps, grunting]

00:30:58.400 --> 00:30:59.693
[gasps]

00:31:00.986 --> 00:31:03.864
[grunting, exclaiming]

00:31:06.783 --> 00:31:07.826
[yelps]

00:31:09.369 --> 00:31:10.621
[breathes deeply]

00:31:12.247 --> 00:31:14.833
Just how unlucky are you?

00:31:14.917 --> 00:31:18.003
Yeah, super-duper unlucky.

00:31:18.086 --> 00:31:21.423
Well, I wish you would have made that
clear before we shook on our little deal.

00:31:21.507 --> 00:31:24.510
Oh! [chuckles] Hi, guys. Hi, there.

00:31:24.593 --> 00:31:27.679
Just checking on the rail grips. [groans]

00:31:27.763 --> 00:31:30.682
-There is no unlucky here.
-[grunting]

00:31:30.766 --> 00:31:34.561
So if you want that lucky penny for your
wee friend, you best start blending in.

00:31:34.645 --> 00:31:36.939
Uh, that's what I was trying to do.

00:31:37.022 --> 00:31:38.232
Aha!

00:31:38.315 --> 00:31:40.275
Well, that was your first mistake.

00:31:40.359 --> 00:31:42.528
Lucky creatures don't try.

00:31:42.611 --> 00:31:43.779
They don't have to.

00:31:43.862 --> 00:31:46.490
And stop sweating.
They don't do that either.

00:31:46.573 --> 00:31:47.908
Right, okay.

00:31:47.991 --> 00:31:49.785
-I'll try my best.
-Uh-uh.

00:31:49.868 --> 00:31:53.121
I mean,
I'll try to act like I'm not trying.

00:31:53.997 --> 00:31:55.290
Good answer.

00:31:58.043 --> 00:31:59.461
We've got to find Gerry.

00:31:59.545 --> 00:32:02.214
He'll know
how all this penny business works.

00:32:02.297 --> 00:32:04.299
He'll be the super cheery one in green.

00:32:06.343 --> 00:32:08.011
They all look like that.

00:32:08.804 --> 00:32:11.557
Slainte, friends. What is the story?

00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:13.016
There he is.

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:16.395
-O'Neill!
-[munches, slurps]

00:32:16.478 --> 00:32:17.980
O'Reilly, O'Donoghue.

00:32:18.063 --> 00:32:20.691
-[speaks indistinctly]
-Barry.

00:32:23.527 --> 00:32:25.279
And I didn't forget you, Clarisse.

00:32:25.362 --> 00:32:28.073
-I've got your microbrew right here.
-Thanks, Gerry!

00:32:28.156 --> 00:32:30.701
-Is he thoughtful or what?
-Gerry!

00:32:33.537 --> 00:32:35.247
Sam, Gerry.

00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:36.915
Oh, you're grand.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.878
Um, are those my clothes?

00:32:40.961 --> 00:32:43.422
Sorry, Bob said you wouldn't mind.

00:32:43.505 --> 00:32:46.508
Uh, Sam's visiting from Latvia. Her
clothes got all messed up on arrival and--

00:32:46.592 --> 00:32:49.428
[gasps] So, you live in the human world?

00:32:49.511 --> 00:32:50.596
Uh, usually.

00:32:50.679 --> 00:32:54.683
Oh, man!
Have you ever tried grilled cheese?

00:32:54.766 --> 00:32:55.976
I have.

00:32:56.059 --> 00:32:57.144
[whimpers]

00:32:57.227 --> 00:33:01.398
Right. So, Ger, as you know,
cats aren't allowed inside the Depot,

00:33:01.481 --> 00:33:03.942
and Sam's a wee bit nervous
about her first shift.

00:33:04.026 --> 00:33:08.238
So I was thinking maybe you could escort
her in and, you know, show her the ropes.

00:33:08.322 --> 00:33:10.782
Lucky me. Of course.

00:33:10.866 --> 00:33:12.784
So, it's super easy.

00:33:12.868 --> 00:33:14.536
You sit in the chair,
the penny comes to you,

00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:16.246
you polish it up and send it on its way.

00:33:16.330 --> 00:33:17.915
Sounds like something I can handle.

00:33:17.998 --> 00:33:19.291
Of course you can.

00:33:19.374 --> 00:33:21.877
Lucky leprechauns were made
for this kind of work.

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:24.588
-[Irish jig music playing]
-[whistle blows]

00:33:24.671 --> 00:33:26.215
Ooh. That's us.

00:33:27.174 --> 00:33:30.010
-Uh-uh.
-[chuckling] Go ahead. I'll catch up.

00:33:30.093 --> 00:33:31.303
[Gerry] Okeydoke.

00:33:31.386 --> 00:33:33.388
Um, I think we should abort.

00:33:33.472 --> 00:33:34.890
What, why?

00:33:34.973 --> 00:33:36.975
You're not a lucky leprechaun, Sam.

00:33:37.059 --> 00:33:39.478
You're an insanely unlucky human.

00:33:39.561 --> 00:33:41.980
-Or maybe you've forgotten.
-Trust me. I haven't.

00:33:42.064 --> 00:33:43.398
You'll cause a disaster.

00:33:43.482 --> 00:33:46.985
Maybe not. Gerry said we sit
in chairs and polish pennies.

00:33:47.069 --> 00:33:49.780
And I imagine to polish a penny,
you need to hold a penny.

00:33:49.863 --> 00:33:51.657
And if I'm holding a lucky penny--

00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:53.909
I get it. You'll be lucky.

00:33:53.992 --> 00:33:56.745
Pocket one penny. How hard could it be?

00:33:58.914 --> 00:34:00.123
[Gerry] Sam, over here.

00:34:00.207 --> 00:34:02.501
-You'll sit right next to me.
-Thanks, Gerry.

00:34:02.584 --> 00:34:06.839
Okay, leprechauns,
let's get these pennies in tip-top shape.

00:34:06.922 --> 00:34:08.924
The Captain is depending on us.

00:34:09.007 --> 00:34:12.469
-[blows whistle] It's penny time!
-[Irish jig music playing]

00:34:15.889 --> 00:34:19.768
Remember, there is nothing to it.
Just stay in your chair.

00:34:23.355 --> 00:34:24.898
Grab a penny, Sam.

00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:15.407
-[grunts]
-[leprechauns yelping]

00:35:16.283 --> 00:35:17.826
[grunting]

00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:18.994
[all] Whoa!

00:35:19.953 --> 00:35:21.830
[grunting, yelping continues]

00:35:21.914 --> 00:35:23.332
[grunts, groans]

00:35:26.418 --> 00:35:27.753
[gasps]

00:35:34.259 --> 00:35:35.469
[alarm blares]

00:35:35.552 --> 00:35:37.262
[stammers] Uh, don't panic.

00:35:37.346 --> 00:35:38.764
[leprechauns muttering]

00:35:38.847 --> 00:35:40.682
You think it was
a bad luck speck that did it?

00:35:40.766 --> 00:35:42.392
More like a whole boot full.

00:35:42.476 --> 00:35:43.894
Sam!

00:35:43.977 --> 00:35:46.146
I told you this would be a disaster.

00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:49.566
Well, I didn't expect to get the button.
You saw that, right?

00:35:49.650 --> 00:35:50.901
Oh, yes, I saw it.

00:35:50.984 --> 00:35:54.571
And now that button's headed
straight back to Arrivals and Departures,

00:35:54.655 --> 00:35:56.490
where the Captain will see it for sure.

00:35:56.573 --> 00:35:58.367
So, where are we gonna find a penny now?

00:35:58.450 --> 00:36:00.327
[stammers] We're not!

00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:02.829
This was it, our one chance.

00:36:02.913 --> 00:36:04.414
And now you leave.

00:36:04.498 --> 00:36:07.793
No, no, no.
The deal was I leave after we get a penny.

00:36:07.876 --> 00:36:11.505
The deal is off.
There's nowhere else to get a penny.

00:36:11.588 --> 00:36:12.798
Someone need a penny?

00:36:12.881 --> 00:36:14.132
Bob does.

00:36:14.216 --> 00:36:16.510
He lost his,
and then I flushed it down the toilet--

00:36:16.593 --> 00:36:18.595
-Sam!
-What? He's your friend.

00:36:18.679 --> 00:36:21.139
-Assistant.
-This is terrible, Bob.

00:36:21.223 --> 00:36:23.559
You stopped to eat human food again,
didn't you?

00:36:23.642 --> 00:36:25.978
-Yeah. My human food.
-Sam!

00:36:26.061 --> 00:36:27.896
What do you mean, your human food?

00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:30.858
I'm not a Latvian leprechaun, Gerry.
I'm a human.

00:36:30.941 --> 00:36:32.484
-[shudders]
-[groans]

00:36:34.361 --> 00:36:36.446
Humans cannot be here!

00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:37.906
Yeah, Bob mentioned that.

00:36:38.490 --> 00:36:42.703
So, you lost your travel penny
and brought a human through the portal.

00:36:42.786 --> 00:36:44.580
Oh, the Captain is not gonna like this.

00:36:44.663 --> 00:36:47.541
And if she finds out,
you'll be banished to Bad Luck!

00:36:47.624 --> 00:36:49.626
Wait. There's a Bad Luck here too?

00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:52.671
Well, not here, here,
but down there, here, yeah.

00:36:52.754 --> 00:36:54.464
It's the other half of our world.

00:36:54.548 --> 00:36:57.050
Good Luck on top
and Bad Luck on the bottom,

00:36:57.134 --> 00:36:58.802
only their half isn't so nice.

00:36:58.886 --> 00:37:02.389
Of course, it isn't.
Bad luck ruins everything it touches.

00:37:02.472 --> 00:37:04.766
Why didn't you tell me that's
where you'll be banished, Bob?

00:37:04.850 --> 00:37:07.686
-You never asked.
-Because you said no more questions.

00:37:07.769 --> 00:37:09.229
[sirens wailing]

00:37:09.313 --> 00:37:11.023
They called in the hazmats.

00:37:25.579 --> 00:37:28.332
[screams] It's the Captain. Quick, hide.

00:37:28.415 --> 00:37:29.416
That might be tough.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.752
All right, everyone, clear out.

00:37:31.835 --> 00:37:35.297
Evacuate the area
so the rabbits can do their work.

00:37:37.799 --> 00:37:39.760
Bob, is that you?

00:37:39.843 --> 00:37:41.094
Ah, no, Cap.

00:37:41.178 --> 00:37:44.640
It's me, Gerry,
from Arrivals and Departures, remember?

00:37:44.723 --> 00:37:48.477
-I've been working for you for 100 years--
-Gerry. Gerry. When did you grow a tail?

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:52.105
-Is the-- Is there a tail there?
-Captain, what a delight!

00:37:52.189 --> 00:37:54.358
And so soon. Lucky me.

00:37:54.441 --> 00:37:55.776
What are you doing down here?

00:37:55.859 --> 00:37:58.362
Oh, just visiting my leprechaun friends.

00:37:58.445 --> 00:38:00.531
You don't have friends, Bob.

00:38:00.614 --> 00:38:04.201
They've scanned the crime scene, Captain,
and found no bad luck specks.

00:38:04.284 --> 00:38:05.452
Scan it again.

00:38:05.536 --> 00:38:09.540
One speck can de-luckify
an entire pile of lucky pennies.

00:38:10.749 --> 00:38:12.209
Let's get outta here.

00:38:12.835 --> 00:38:15.295
So, there's really no other place
to get a penny?

00:38:15.379 --> 00:38:16.380
No!

00:38:16.463 --> 00:38:18.966
What about the ones like Bob's
that go missing in the human world?

00:38:19.049 --> 00:38:21.510
If they're so valuable,
why don't you go retrieve them?

00:38:21.593 --> 00:38:23.512
-Oh, we do.
-We do?

00:38:23.595 --> 00:38:24.638
Well, we used to.

00:38:24.721 --> 00:38:27.432
But not one has been lost
since the Captain took over security.

00:38:27.516 --> 00:38:30.310
The old days, if a travel penny
went missing in the human world,

00:38:30.394 --> 00:38:32.479
-we'd send in the bunny drone.
-"Bunny drone"?

00:38:32.563 --> 00:38:36.525
Yeah. Clever little robot.
They keep it at Arrivals and Departures.

00:38:36.608 --> 00:38:37.985
So, let's go get it.

00:38:38.068 --> 00:38:40.445
Okay! But it hasn't been used in a decade.

00:38:40.529 --> 00:38:43.282
So, first, we'll have to grab
a good luck crystal to power it.

00:38:43.365 --> 00:38:45.993
-And where do we get one of those?
-The Luck Floor!

00:38:46.076 --> 00:38:47.494
Whoa, whoa. Hold up a minute.

00:38:47.578 --> 00:38:50.747
I'll head to Arrivals and Departures
and fire up the bunny drone

00:38:50.831 --> 00:38:52.499
while you two sneak into Mission Control.

00:38:52.583 --> 00:38:53.834
Wait. Why?

00:38:53.917 --> 00:38:56.795
That's where they keep the joystick
that controls the drone.

00:38:56.879 --> 00:38:58.922
Great! But crystal first.

00:38:59.006 --> 00:39:01.633
So, Luck Floor, here we come.

00:39:01.717 --> 00:39:06.013
Ooh, but the crystals are up high.
We'll need someone tall to reach it.

00:39:06.096 --> 00:39:08.307
-I'm tall.
-Not a chance.

00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:10.642
-She's way too unlucky.
-It's true.

00:39:10.726 --> 00:39:14.062
Oh, she only has to grab one.
I think she can do it.

00:39:16.064 --> 00:39:18.901
Oh, fine. I mean, what could go wrong?

00:39:18.984 --> 00:39:20.611
That's the spirit, boss.

00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:29.286
[whispering] Sounds like our little deal
is back on, Bob.

00:39:29.369 --> 00:39:32.414
-[whispering] Yes, and then you'll leave.
-True to my word.

00:39:33.624 --> 00:39:35.292
So, where do we get the luck crystal?

00:39:35.375 --> 00:39:37.794
[Gerry] We'll just walk down the hall
and snag one.

00:39:37.878 --> 00:39:39.129
Piece of cake.

00:39:45.844 --> 00:39:49.306
They're all staring right at Sam.
What do we do, boss?

00:39:51.225 --> 00:39:55.521
She's from Latvia. Tallest leprechauns
in the world come from Latvia.

00:39:55.604 --> 00:39:58.982
And we're her Land of Luck
leprechaun orientation guides.

00:40:01.109 --> 00:40:02.986
Lead on, Gerry.

00:40:03.070 --> 00:40:04.738
Uh, right!

00:40:09.451 --> 00:40:14.498
So, this is Good Luck R and D,
where good luck is created.

00:40:15.290 --> 00:40:18.001
Finding your lost wedding ring
in the brownies?

00:40:18.085 --> 00:40:20.379
Shirley always comes up
with the best stuff.

00:40:20.462 --> 00:40:23.632
Wait. They actually think up
the good luck?

00:40:23.715 --> 00:40:26.260
Yeah. Those two work in Happy Accidents,

00:40:26.343 --> 00:40:29.680
one of the many Good Luck departments
like Lucky in Love,

00:40:30.347 --> 00:40:33.475
Front Row Parking Spot-- Ooh!
Right Place, Right Time.

00:40:33.559 --> 00:40:35.435
You humans love that one.

00:40:35.519 --> 00:40:39.565
And by "humans," you mean
the ones who live in the human world,

00:40:39.648 --> 00:40:40.858
don't ya, Ger?

00:40:40.941 --> 00:40:42.901
Exactly right.

00:40:42.985 --> 00:40:46.530
Next, the lucky ideas are
stamped onto an idea leaf,

00:40:46.613 --> 00:40:48.240
and then sent to the Luck Floor.

00:40:48.991 --> 00:40:51.952
And luck passing through
in five, four, three, two…

00:40:52.035 --> 00:40:54.705
Let's take this tour
to the upper level, shall we?

00:41:08.051 --> 00:41:10.804
[Gerry] The ladybugs deliver the leaves
to the Pig Foreman.

00:41:10.888 --> 00:41:12.431
And he makes the crystals?

00:41:12.514 --> 00:41:14.558
Nah, they do.

00:41:16.226 --> 00:41:20.063
Latvia. She's from Latvia. Latvia.

00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:27.362
For the crystal.
Janice said I could borrow it.

00:41:27.446 --> 00:41:29.573
All right, luck makers!

00:41:29.656 --> 00:41:32.034
We've got a full docket today!

00:41:32.117 --> 00:41:34.828
Good morning, magical swine!

00:41:34.912 --> 00:41:36.079
-A dragon?
-[pigs cheer]

00:41:36.163 --> 00:41:37.831
Yeah, she's the CEO of Good Luck.

00:41:40.209 --> 00:41:43.504
And the only creature
that can sniff out bad luck specks.

00:41:43.587 --> 00:41:45.005
Probably why she's here.

00:41:45.088 --> 00:41:47.257
She must've heard what happened
at the Penny Depot.

00:41:47.341 --> 00:41:49.968
[sniffing]

00:41:51.094 --> 00:41:54.723
Uh, with your luck,
I wouldnae get too close.

00:41:56.141 --> 00:41:57.935
Ta-da!

00:41:58.018 --> 00:42:00.437
There's not a speck of bad luck here.

00:42:00.521 --> 00:42:04.149
-[cheering, whistling]
-Which means it's that time again.

00:42:04.233 --> 00:42:08.612
Time to open your hearts
to do what only you can do.

00:42:08.695 --> 00:42:11.990
-Let me hear it!
-Bring hope and joy to the world!

00:42:12.074 --> 00:42:14.993
-[cheers, whistles]
-That's what good luck does.

00:42:15.077 --> 00:42:18.539
The luck you create today
could change a life tomorrow.

00:42:20.499 --> 00:42:22.042
Have a lucky day, Phil.

00:42:22.125 --> 00:42:23.460
You too, Boss.

00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:31.677
[Phil] Okay, you heard her!

00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:35.764
Let's make some good luck,
you prosperity-making wonder pigs!

00:42:35.848 --> 00:42:37.057
[Bob] Duck down!

00:42:40.227 --> 00:42:41.478
[blowing]

00:42:46.608 --> 00:42:48.861
[Sam] They're doing it.
They're making the crystals.

00:42:48.944 --> 00:42:50.612
And we just need one for the bunny drone.

00:42:50.696 --> 00:42:53.574
-This is it, Sam. Get ready.
-Ready.

00:42:53.657 --> 00:42:56.535
-Now, Sam! Grab one!
-[strains]

00:42:56.618 --> 00:42:59.997
I can't quite reach. [strains]

00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:02.416
-Jump!
-No, she's too unlucky!

00:43:02.499 --> 00:43:03.500
[grunts]

00:43:04.042 --> 00:43:05.460
Whoa! [gasps]

00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:08.130
[gasps]

00:43:09.214 --> 00:43:10.465
[exclaims]

00:43:12.551 --> 00:43:15.470
[sighs] Nice move, Bob!

00:43:15.554 --> 00:43:17.306
Way to go, team!

00:43:17.389 --> 00:43:20.017
I'll go to Arrivals and Departures
and find the drone.

00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:21.685
You guys head straight to Mission Control.

00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:26.523
Because of you, Bob has a real chance.

00:43:27.357 --> 00:43:29.359
You can keep my jacket if you want!

00:43:30.402 --> 00:43:31.904
You have nice friends.

00:43:31.987 --> 00:43:34.698
Yeah, like I said, he's just my assistant.

00:43:36.783 --> 00:43:39.244
I know we'd still need
to get you a lucky penny,

00:43:39.328 --> 00:43:41.914
but why couldn't I just take Hazel
one of those?

00:43:41.997 --> 00:43:43.415
[Bob] It doesn't work that way.

00:43:43.498 --> 00:43:46.877
The good luck idea is stored
inside the crystal until it's released,

00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:48.795
and there's only one thing
that can release it.

00:43:48.879 --> 00:43:50.714
-What's that?
-The Randomizer.

00:43:50.797 --> 00:43:53.133
It smashes the crystals into lucky dust,

00:43:53.217 --> 00:43:56.178
then sends it randomly
through the luck lines into your world.

00:43:56.261 --> 00:43:58.680
Wait. You're saying luck is random?

00:43:58.764 --> 00:44:01.934
Aye. Hence the name, Randomizer.

00:44:02.017 --> 00:44:04.019
Look, it's happening right now.

00:44:04.603 --> 00:44:07.189
-[Sam] What are those?
-[Bob] The ancient luck stones.

00:44:07.272 --> 00:44:09.691
Like the batteries
that keep the arms spinning.

00:44:09.775 --> 00:44:12.694
The good luck stone draws in
the good luck from above,

00:44:12.778 --> 00:44:15.864
and the bad luck stone draws in
the bad luck from below.

00:44:16.823 --> 00:44:18.784
And those must be the luck lines.

00:44:18.867 --> 00:44:19.868
[Bob] Aye, that's them.

00:44:19.952 --> 00:44:22.329
Like the power cords
connecting our worlds.

00:44:22.996 --> 00:44:25.040
So, who makes the bad luck?

00:44:25.123 --> 00:44:26.583
Roots and goblins, mainly.

00:44:26.667 --> 00:44:28.752
Roots and goblins?

00:44:28.836 --> 00:44:31.255
I should have known it would be monsters.

00:44:31.338 --> 00:44:32.756
Gerry, are ya there?

00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:34.925
[Gerry] 10-4.
Reading you loud and clear, boss.

00:44:35.008 --> 00:44:36.260
[Bob] Where are you?

00:44:36.343 --> 00:44:38.846
[whispering] Entering
Arrivals and Departures right now.

00:44:38.929 --> 00:44:40.347
[Bob] Good. Make it quick.

00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:43.976
-Oh. Hey, Gerry.
-[clears throat] Gael. Quinn.

00:44:53.068 --> 00:44:55.696
-[Gerry] I found the drone.
-Good. We're here.

00:44:55.779 --> 00:44:57.447
-Mission Control.
-[Gerry] Great.

00:44:57.531 --> 00:45:00.033
-All the bunny desks have a joystick.
-Perfect!

00:45:00.117 --> 00:45:03.620
We'll use that back one.
That way no one can see my screen.

00:45:03.704 --> 00:45:05.581
But how are we gonna distract the bunny?

00:45:05.664 --> 00:45:07.708
-Ooh! Maybe I could try--
-Uh-uh!

00:45:07.791 --> 00:45:11.336
No trying, remember?
We've seen what happens when you do.

00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:12.671
Oh, okay.

00:45:12.754 --> 00:45:15.632
I've got this one covered.
You wait right here.

00:45:15.716 --> 00:45:18.802
I mean it. Don't move a muscle.

00:45:22.306 --> 00:45:25.267
[Sam] Whoa.
They're tracking luck all over the world.

00:45:34.526 --> 00:45:36.486
That's one lucky grandma.

00:45:38.113 --> 00:45:39.114
Aw.

00:45:42.409 --> 00:45:44.244
Now, that looks familiar.

00:45:44.995 --> 00:45:46.038
Ooh.

00:45:46.121 --> 00:45:48.373
It doesn't feel random, does it?

00:45:50.417 --> 00:45:53.170
So, how's your day so far?

00:45:53.253 --> 00:45:54.338
Good.

00:45:55.047 --> 00:45:57.007
[gasps] Ooh, carrot.

00:45:57.090 --> 00:45:58.550
[keyboard clatters]

00:45:58.634 --> 00:46:00.219
Dropped your keyboard.

00:46:00.302 --> 00:46:03.597
Guess you better run off to IT
and grab a new one.

00:46:06.016 --> 00:46:07.017
[beeps]

00:46:11.563 --> 00:46:13.232
Joystick activated, Gerry.

00:46:13.315 --> 00:46:14.566
We're nearly there.

00:46:15.150 --> 00:46:16.693
I'm putting in the crystal.

00:46:17.236 --> 00:46:18.612
[drone beeps]

00:46:18.695 --> 00:46:20.697
She's ready for takeoff, boss.

00:46:20.781 --> 00:46:23.534
Brilliant! The target's been located.

00:46:23.617 --> 00:46:25.369
Let's get that bunny in the air.

00:46:25.452 --> 00:46:28.288
[drone whirs]

00:46:28.372 --> 00:46:30.457
Operation "lucky penny" is a go!

00:46:30.541 --> 00:46:32.626
-[beeps]
-[Gerry] She's all yours.

00:46:32.709 --> 00:46:33.961
Yes!

00:46:34.044 --> 00:46:36.755
[Gerry] Just get her
within striking distance of the target.

00:46:36.839 --> 00:46:39.299
When she's close enough,
she'll lock onto it.

00:46:40.175 --> 00:46:41.343
I'll open the portal.

00:47:00.737 --> 00:47:04.950
Oh, no! [whispering] Bob, look up.
Look up. Bob, Bob.

A button.

Whoever turned in this button
did not turn in their travel penny,

00:49:03.819 --> 00:49:06.613

a penny thief amongst us.

00:50:25.692 --> 00:50:28.403
It's the space between the lands

00:50:28.487 --> 00:50:30.989

BL, basement level. Why?

00:50:57.975 --> 00:51:04.439

You're supposed to push IB, In Between.

attracts more bad luck?

00:58:24.296 --> 00:58:26.673
Okay, ja, sure, the name fit better
when I was younger.

00:58:26.757 --> 00:58:29.009
I get it. You don't have to say it.

00:58:29.885 --> 00:58:31.470
Is that the Dragon?

00:58:31.553 --> 00:58:34.014
Ja, that's her. Meine one true love.

00:58:34.097 --> 00:58:37.601
She smelted me this locket,
and she saved my life.

00:58:37.684 --> 00:58:38.977
What happened?

00:58:39.061 --> 00:58:44.107
Before my mixing machine, I had to clean
out the bad luck clogs by hand.

00:58:44.191 --> 00:58:50.697
And one day the pipe, it plätzen!
And gesprüht bad luck dust all over me.

00:58:50.781 --> 00:58:56.161
The Dragon heard and sent for me sofort.
It was love at first look.

00:58:56.245 --> 00:58:59.623
She borrowed me a lucky penny
to counteract the bad luck.

00:58:59.706 --> 00:59:02.251
But bad luck can really linger.

00:59:02.334 --> 00:59:08.173
It took four months to recover, but they
were the beste four months of my life.

00:59:08.757 --> 00:59:11.009
And then she broke my heart.

00:59:11.093 --> 00:59:12.094
Why?

00:59:12.177 --> 00:59:15.013
Well, sometimes I would track
a little bad luck into Good Luck

00:59:15.097 --> 00:59:16.390
on my shoesies.

00:59:16.473 --> 00:59:21.436
She was so terrified of what bad luck
might do to her creatures and her world,

00:59:21.520 --> 00:59:23.021
so she broke it off.

00:59:23.105 --> 00:59:24.731
And now we're both alone.

00:59:25.482 --> 00:59:26.608
How sad.

00:59:30.487 --> 00:59:32.406
[Jeff]
If I could leave meine work, I would.

00:59:32.489 --> 00:59:36.577
But we einhorn have cared for
the Randomizer since the buttocks of dawn.

00:59:36.660 --> 00:59:39.830
-[signal blaring]
-Oh, goody! A delivery!

00:59:45.752 --> 00:59:48.005
Oh! Da bist du, Robert! [chuckles]

00:59:48.088 --> 00:59:52.301
Guess what? Earlier,
I found a bunny drone in the pile. Mm-hmm.

00:59:52.384 --> 00:59:55.012
Ja, just one. Ja, I wanted a set of six.

00:59:55.095 --> 00:59:56.346
Do you still have it?

00:59:58.015 --> 00:59:59.433
Und here she is.

00:59:59.516 --> 01:00:01.727
-Was there a penny?
-Ja, Robert.

01:00:01.810 --> 01:00:05.856
But it was so stinky,
so I sent it up to the Penny Depot

01:00:05.939 --> 01:00:09.109
to be disinfected
and put back into circulation.

01:00:11.278 --> 01:00:13.071
[elevator dings, whirs]

01:00:13.155 --> 01:00:16.742
I heard the Captain interrogated poor Edna
for hours about that penny.

01:00:16.825 --> 01:00:18.702
She was clean as a whistle, of course.

01:00:18.785 --> 01:00:22.331
So now it's down to just two cats,
Ernie and Bob.

01:00:22.414 --> 01:00:23.832
I'm doomed.

01:00:26.210 --> 01:00:29.922
Maybe not. You lay low.
I'm going to see the Dragon.

01:00:30.005 --> 01:00:32.633
You can't, Sam.
She'll sniff out your bad luck.

01:00:32.716 --> 01:00:37.513
That's exactly what I want her to do.
And I'm not taking any chances.

01:00:37.596 --> 01:00:39.932
If the Dragon helped an engineer unicorn,

01:00:40.015 --> 01:00:42.309
maybe she'll help
an unlucky leprechaun too.

01:00:42.392 --> 01:00:45.521
If she discovers you're a human,
she'll never let you go home.

01:00:45.604 --> 01:00:47.481
I have to risk it.

01:00:47.564 --> 01:00:50.567
I can't give up on Hazel. Or you, Bob.

01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:53.153
Don't go far.

01:00:53.237 --> 01:00:55.614
If I get a penny, we're back in business.

01:01:00.452 --> 01:01:04.248
Good afternoon,
I'm here to see the Dragon.

01:01:04.831 --> 01:01:05.666
[intercom beeps]

01:01:05.749 --> 01:01:09.670
Leapin' rabbits! It's the tall leprechaun.

01:01:09.753 --> 01:01:11.213
Send her in, Hopsberg.

01:01:11.797 --> 01:01:13.549
And the memos too.

01:01:22.099 --> 01:01:24.059
Twice in one day.

01:01:24.142 --> 01:01:26.770
You were on the Luck Floor this morning,
right?

01:01:26.854 --> 01:01:28.856
Yes, that was me.

01:01:28.939 --> 01:01:30.315
I thought so.

01:01:30.399 --> 01:01:34.361
Aha. Luck levels looking excellent
as usual.

01:01:36.196 --> 01:01:37.531
See you next week.

01:01:38.490 --> 01:01:39.658
Oh, I'm so happy.

01:01:39.741 --> 01:01:43.954
There are so few creatures
here I can actually look in the eye.

01:01:44.037 --> 01:01:47.541
We lucky ladies of stature
oughta stick together, don't you think?

01:01:47.624 --> 01:01:48.709
Yeah.

01:01:48.792 --> 01:01:52.004
[sniffing] What's this?

01:01:54.923 --> 01:01:57.676
[shudders, gasps] Rabbits!

01:01:59.094 --> 01:02:00.721
[retching]

01:02:02.598 --> 01:02:04.892
Under the-- the shoe.

01:02:04.975 --> 01:02:07.144
[breathes heavily] Hurry!

01:02:07.227 --> 01:02:09.271
[coughing]

01:02:09.354 --> 01:02:14.151
Oh-- [breathes heavily, coughs]

01:02:17.905 --> 01:02:19.698
[sighs] Much better.

01:02:19.781 --> 01:02:26.205
You see, the tiniest amount of bad luck
can shut down our entire operation.

01:02:26.788 --> 01:02:29.791
[sighs] We work so hard to keep it out,
but, you know,

01:02:29.875 --> 01:02:35.214
every so often,
bad luck manages to find its way in.

01:02:35.297 --> 01:02:38.717
I'm really sorry. I didn't mean
to upset you. I just--

01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:42.012
It's not you, dear.
Oh, no, no. It's bad luck.

01:02:42.095 --> 01:02:46.016
It's a cruel, corrosive agent of sadness
and destruction that--

01:02:46.099 --> 01:02:49.102
[gasping, sighs]

01:02:49.186 --> 01:02:52.606
I agree. And it explains a lot.

01:02:52.689 --> 01:02:55.526
Why it all went haywire
at the Penny Depot for one.

01:02:55.609 --> 01:02:57.194
Ah, so that was you.

01:02:57.277 --> 01:03:00.531
Yeah. It's been a bit of a day.

01:03:00.614 --> 01:03:03.075
Oh, poor, innocent leprechaun.

01:03:03.158 --> 01:03:08.914
I'm so sorry you had to go through that.
And you only experienced one speck.

01:03:08.997 --> 01:03:13.085
Think of the poor souls in the Land of
the Unlucky tasked with making the stuff.

01:03:13.168 --> 01:03:19.091
Can you imagine dealing with bad luck
every single day of your life?

01:03:19.716 --> 01:03:23.554
-A truly miserable existence.
-Yeah.

01:03:23.637 --> 01:03:26.807
And I don't suppose it's much fun
for the humans who receive it either.

01:03:26.890 --> 01:03:28.308
It isn't.

01:03:28.392 --> 01:03:31.895
I've seen them when I'm out leprechauning.

01:03:32.396 --> 01:03:38.026
These unlucky humans, who,
no matter how hard they try,

01:03:38.777 --> 01:03:44.283
bad luck always shows up just
to beat them down and make them feel so…

01:03:44.366 --> 01:03:46.034
Alone.

01:03:47.035 --> 01:03:48.203
Exactly.

01:03:49.580 --> 01:03:52.124
Which is why
we make the good kind of luck,

01:03:52.207 --> 01:03:54.751
and as much as we possibly can.

01:03:54.835 --> 01:03:55.919
Yeah.

01:03:56.003 --> 01:03:59.798
'Cause when you have good luck,
it feels like anything is possible.

01:03:59.882 --> 01:04:02.467
-I guess it's because--
-Good luck is joy.

01:04:02.551 --> 01:04:03.552
Yes.

01:04:04.303 --> 01:04:08.682
And hope. It's like you said,
it's the good kind of luck.

01:04:09.433 --> 01:04:15.230
And were I the queen of the universe,
and I suspect it's a job I would excel at,

01:04:15.314 --> 01:04:17.482
I'd rid the world of bad luck altogether!

01:04:17.566 --> 01:04:20.819
-[gasps, screams]
-Eradicate it completely.

01:04:20.903 --> 01:04:25.365
Good luck all the time,
what could be better?

01:04:25.449 --> 01:04:26.700
Not a single thing.

01:04:26.783 --> 01:04:29.536
And you can bet
those humans would like it too.

01:04:29.620 --> 01:04:33.874
Yeah.
Then their world could look like this.

01:04:33.957 --> 01:04:36.001
[chuckles] They should be so lucky.

01:04:36.084 --> 01:04:40.464
You did the right thing coming to see me.
You-- What was your name?

01:04:40.547 --> 01:04:43.050
Oh, Sam. My name is Sam.

01:04:44.092 --> 01:04:46.720
Sam. Call me Babe.

01:04:46.803 --> 01:04:50.641
You know a lot of creatures
are intimidated by tall women, Sam.

01:04:58.273 --> 01:05:02.110
Carry it for a few days. You'll be back
to your lucky self in no time.

01:05:03.612 --> 01:05:07.241
The last creature I helped
needed four months with a penny

01:05:07.324 --> 01:05:09.076
until his bad luck was gone.

01:05:09.660 --> 01:05:11.370
I've heard it can really linger.

01:05:11.954 --> 01:05:14.748
They were the best four months of my life.

01:05:14.831 --> 01:05:17.000
[sighs]

01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:19.461
Thank you, Babe.

01:05:21.964 --> 01:05:24.258
Just return it to the Depot
when you're done.

01:05:24.341 --> 01:05:25.676
I will.

01:05:26.510 --> 01:05:28.220
[laughs]

01:05:28.303 --> 01:05:32.099
You're about to make
a little girl and a lucky cat so happy.

01:05:32.182 --> 01:05:34.351
[Bob] Whoa, whoa, whoa! Take it easy!

01:05:34.434 --> 01:05:37.229
Get off me.
I won't be cat-handled like this.

01:05:37.312 --> 01:05:40.023
We traced the missing penny
back to you, Bob.

01:05:40.107 --> 01:05:41.400
You have no proof.

01:05:41.483 --> 01:05:43.443
This button is all the proof we need.

01:05:43.527 --> 01:05:45.904
It's got your polydactyl paw prints
all over it.

01:05:45.988 --> 01:05:48.282
-[Bob stammers] I can explain.
-It's too late.

01:05:48.365 --> 01:05:51.076
You'll be banished
to Bad Luck where you belong.

01:05:59.209 --> 01:06:01.378
[grunting]

01:06:02.421 --> 01:06:03.422
[grunts]

01:06:08.468 --> 01:06:11.972
Obstructing justice?
I oughta arrest you too.

01:06:12.055 --> 01:06:14.766
I was just catching up to Bob
to give him this.

01:06:15.350 --> 01:06:16.560
You got it.

01:06:16.643 --> 01:06:18.687
Yes, Bob. I did.

01:06:18.770 --> 01:06:21.231
Must've fallen right out of his collar.

01:06:22.482 --> 01:06:25.652
Maybe when you stopped
to try that tasty meat bread.

01:06:25.736 --> 01:06:28.864
And you're absolutely sure
this one is mine?

01:06:29.615 --> 01:06:30.616
I'm sure.

01:06:30.699 --> 01:06:33.744
[chuckles]
She's a real lifesaver, this one.

01:06:33.827 --> 01:06:37.623
[grumbling] If you had your travel penny,
why did you turn in the button, Bob?

01:06:37.706 --> 01:06:41.084
Silly mistake.
I just threw the wrong one into the drop.

01:06:41.168 --> 01:06:42.503
When I discovered the mix-up,

01:06:42.586 --> 01:06:45.339
I was heading
straight back to Decon to turn it in,

01:06:45.422 --> 01:06:49.009
and then I guess that's
when the little bugger just slipped out.

01:06:49.092 --> 01:06:51.845
[chuckles]
Just like that, no travel penny.

01:06:51.929 --> 01:06:52.763
You know,

01:06:52.846 --> 01:06:58.268
I'm starting to think that maybe the
equipment rabbits issued me a bum collar.

01:06:58.352 --> 01:07:00.604
This isn't the first time
it's got loose, you know.

01:07:00.687 --> 01:07:02.064
Oh, I see. I see.

01:07:02.147 --> 01:07:06.610
Well, faulty equipment is unacceptable,
Bob. You're right.

01:07:06.693 --> 01:07:08.946
Aye, it most certainly is.

01:07:09.029 --> 01:07:10.364
Here you go, Captain.

01:07:14.618 --> 01:07:18.956
I can't believe you just did that.
I mean, thank you, like, a lot,

01:07:19.039 --> 01:07:22.125
but you could've taken that penny
straight to your friend Hazel.

01:07:22.209 --> 01:07:25.045
Her first, then me, that was the deal.

01:07:25.128 --> 01:07:29.132
I could never let you be sent to Bad Luck
so that Hazel could have good luck.

01:07:29.216 --> 01:07:31.844
-It doesn't work like that.
-[Bob] Well, how does it work?

01:07:31.927 --> 01:07:35.514
Because I don't want you to go home
and leave me here feeling guilty

01:07:35.597 --> 01:07:37.808
that she doesn't get
to use a lucky penny now.

01:07:37.891 --> 01:07:39.601
You think I'm going home?

01:07:39.685 --> 01:07:41.186
Wait. You're not?

01:07:41.270 --> 01:07:43.355
I came here to help Hazel,

01:07:43.438 --> 01:07:46.525
and I only have one hour left to do it
before her visit.

01:07:46.608 --> 01:07:49.444
If you're actually feeling guilty,
then you can help me.

01:07:49.528 --> 01:07:52.656
But there's no way to get another penny.

01:07:52.739 --> 01:07:55.242
For what we're doing,
we won't need a penny.

01:07:55.951 --> 01:07:57.160
What are we gonna do?

01:07:58.745 --> 01:08:00.497
[Sam] We're gonna turn off bad luck.

01:08:00.581 --> 01:08:02.332
If we shut down Jeff's mixer machine,

01:08:02.416 --> 01:08:05.460
the bad luck should stick to itself
and clog up the pipe

01:08:05.544 --> 01:08:07.296
so it can't travel to the Randomizer.

01:08:07.379 --> 01:08:10.924
And if no bad luck gets to the Randomizer…

01:08:11.008 --> 01:08:13.427
[Sam] No bad luck gets to the human world.

01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:15.095
Wait. What about Jeff?

01:08:15.179 --> 01:08:18.640
Und schneller. Und schneller.
Und steil. Ja, steil.

01:08:18.724 --> 01:08:20.309
Go down that berg.

01:08:21.435 --> 01:08:23.478
I have no words.

01:08:23.562 --> 01:08:26.231
Yeah, I think we're good for a bit.

01:08:27.816 --> 01:08:30.402
You know we can't do this permanently,
right?

01:08:30.484 --> 01:08:33.113
Of course not. That's where you come in.

01:08:33.197 --> 01:08:35.240
I'm gonna turn it back on.

01:08:35.323 --> 01:08:37.451
All Hazel needs is two hours tops.

01:08:37.533 --> 01:08:39.828
And then I flip the switch. And that's it.

01:08:39.912 --> 01:08:44.541
We're even. Fini, complet.
Case closed. Deal done.

01:08:44.625 --> 01:08:46.542
You'll never see my face again.

01:08:47.502 --> 01:08:49.630
Great. Here goes.

01:08:57.804 --> 01:08:59.680
[Bob] Look at that.

01:09:01.099 --> 01:09:02.475
It's starting to stick.

01:09:08.273 --> 01:09:09.274
[Sam] It's working.

01:09:10.067 --> 01:09:11.693
I wish I could see Hazel.

01:09:11.777 --> 01:09:13.612
I think I can handle that.

01:09:13.694 --> 01:09:16.948
Really?
She lives two miles east of the café.

01:09:17.032 --> 01:09:19.618
Tell me again
why she needs good luck so badly.

01:09:19.701 --> 01:09:23.037
If her visit goes well,
she could find her forever family.

01:09:23.121 --> 01:09:24.706
Which is what exactly?

01:09:24.790 --> 01:09:28.502
It's the people who are always there
for you, no matter what happens.

01:09:29.086 --> 01:09:32.130
The ones who don't leave, they stick.

01:09:35.341 --> 01:09:36.426
[Sam gasps] There.

01:09:36.510 --> 01:09:38.511
-[Bob] Is that her?
-[Sam] Yeah.

01:09:38.595 --> 01:09:42.057
It looks like the couple will be there
any minute. It's all I hoped for,

01:09:42.140 --> 01:09:45.644
a little good luck for Hazel,
and we did it, Bob.

01:09:45.727 --> 01:09:47.604
I swear I could hug you right now.

01:09:47.688 --> 01:09:49.689
Cats aren't really huggers.

01:09:49.773 --> 01:09:51.899
Well, I love hugs.

01:09:55.362 --> 01:09:59.116
[sighs] So, that's it then.
Deal finally done.

01:09:59.199 --> 01:10:00.784
Please thank Gerry for me.

01:10:00.868 --> 01:10:03.495
And I'm sorry I stretched out his clothes.

01:10:03.579 --> 01:10:07.666
Hey, Sam. I'm curious.
What do you hope for now?

01:10:07.749 --> 01:10:09.626
Are you asking me questions, Bob?

01:10:09.710 --> 01:10:11.128
Now that you're finally leaving,

01:10:11.211 --> 01:10:13.172
it seemed like a good time
to get to know you better.

01:10:13.255 --> 01:10:14.715
[chuckles] In that case,

01:10:14.798 --> 01:10:18.093
I guess I just hope
I can do something good with my life.

01:10:18.177 --> 01:10:20.846
That my bad luck won't
get in the way, you know?

01:10:20.929 --> 01:10:23.599
Aye. I think I do.

01:10:24.725 --> 01:10:27.561
Right. Well, that's us.

01:10:31.273 --> 01:10:34.109
-[gasps]
-[rumbling, whirring]

01:10:34.193 --> 01:10:35.194
[Sam] Huh?

01:10:37.029 --> 01:10:40.115
It's coming from the In Between.
There must be something wrong.

01:10:40.199 --> 01:10:41.700
[sighs]

01:10:44.745 --> 01:10:46.580
[whirring]

01:10:48.707 --> 01:10:49.708
[screams]

01:11:06.517 --> 01:11:08.018
-[glass shatters]
-[both yelp]

01:11:21.323 --> 01:11:23.116
[screaming]

01:11:34.878 --> 01:11:36.964
I didn't think that was possible.

01:11:37.047 --> 01:11:38.924
Oh, no. Hazel!

01:11:51.144 --> 01:11:52.813
Hazel. No.

01:11:55.023 --> 01:11:56.024
No. [gasps]

01:11:57.568 --> 01:11:58.819
[gasps, pants]

01:12:03.949 --> 01:12:05.450
[cracking]

01:12:05.951 --> 01:12:08.662
[gasps] The good luck stone!

01:12:08.745 --> 01:12:12.416
Oh, this can't be happening.
I need good luck to forge a new one.

01:12:12.499 --> 01:12:15.669
The clovers are shriveled.
The pigs cannot create good luck.

01:12:18.922 --> 01:12:20.549
[pants] What about the pennies?

01:12:22.759 --> 01:12:24.761
[coins clinking]

01:12:24.845 --> 01:12:27.306
Just one lucky penny would be enough.

01:12:27.931 --> 01:12:30.100
They're all contaminated!

01:12:30.184 --> 01:12:31.518
Try this one.

01:12:33.645 --> 01:12:35.230
Is it lucky or not?

01:12:38.775 --> 01:12:39.985
Not.

01:12:41.695 --> 01:12:44.364
Wait. Why do you have that, boss?

01:12:44.448 --> 01:12:47.367
Does this mean you're not lucky?

01:12:48.994 --> 01:12:51.038
I was right all along.

01:12:51.121 --> 01:12:54.333
You're a liar and a thief.
I bet you're not even Scottish.

01:12:55.792 --> 01:12:57.294
I'm not.

01:12:57.377 --> 01:12:58.879
I'm English, actually.

01:12:59.838 --> 01:13:03.258
And I lived eight lives in bad luck
before I found that penny.

01:13:04.051 --> 01:13:06.512
It was the penny that made you lucky.

01:13:06.595 --> 01:13:07.721
Yes.

01:13:08.639 --> 01:13:10.474
I'm a bad luck black cat.

01:13:11.183 --> 01:13:12.392
And I always will be.

01:13:12.476 --> 01:13:13.810
-[crashing]
-[gasps]

01:13:17.523 --> 01:13:20.108
[shattering]

01:13:35.290 --> 01:13:36.542
[Sam] What does that mean?

01:13:36.625 --> 01:13:40.671
The connection between the human world
and the luck world

01:13:40.754 --> 01:13:43.215
has been severed for good.

01:13:43.298 --> 01:13:46.426
[Sam] But there must be a way to fix it!
To reconnect.

01:13:46.510 --> 01:13:50.138
Without good luck, there is no way.

01:13:50.222 --> 01:13:53.433
But I have to get to Hazel!
I have to go home.

01:13:56.562 --> 01:13:58.730
You're a human?

01:14:00.774 --> 01:14:04.653
Yes. And I have to go home.

01:14:04.736 --> 01:14:08.031
[scoffs] And what about our home, Sam?

01:14:09.408 --> 01:14:14.371
We exist to make luck for your world.
What will happen to us now?

01:14:20.627 --> 01:14:22.963
You should never have come here.

01:14:23.589 --> 01:14:26.008
She was only following me.

01:14:26.091 --> 01:14:29.136
I'm so sorry.
I never meant for any of this.

01:14:29.219 --> 01:14:32.431
I was just trying to help my friend.

01:14:32.514 --> 01:14:35.058
[scoffs] And instead,
you've made sure that she

01:14:35.142 --> 01:14:38.937
and no other humans
will ever experience luck again.

01:14:42.608 --> 01:14:45.444
We should just banish both
of them to Bad Luck.

01:14:46.069 --> 01:14:49.823
Oh, what does it matter?
It's all bad luck now.

01:14:52.284 --> 01:14:55.370
See, I knew there was something
off about you, Bob.

01:14:55.454 --> 01:14:58.123
I knew it deep in my soul.

01:14:58.207 --> 01:15:00.501
Only, I didn't stop you in time.

01:15:00.584 --> 01:15:03.587
And I have to live
with that for the rest of my life.

01:15:19.478 --> 01:15:21.396
I should've been better, Sam.

01:15:23.273 --> 01:15:25.901
I should've given you the penny
for your friend.

01:15:27.361 --> 01:15:30.364
If I had, none of this would've happened.

01:15:31.865 --> 01:15:37.037
[Sam] But you were afraid I'd lose it
or flush it down another toilet.

01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:40.207
I was afraid to lose my lucky life.

01:15:40.916 --> 01:15:42.668
And too selfish to risk it.

01:15:43.293 --> 01:15:45.295
Well, you made the right choice.

01:15:45.921 --> 01:15:48.757
-I make things worse. It's what I do.
-Sam--

01:15:48.841 --> 01:15:51.552
You'd think
I would have learned my lesson by now.

01:15:51.635 --> 01:15:53.303
To just lay down for once,

01:15:53.387 --> 01:15:57.057
stop trying so hard,
stop sweating, like you said.

01:15:57.140 --> 01:15:58.725
I should never have said that.

01:15:58.809 --> 01:16:00.435
It's true.

01:16:00.519 --> 01:16:04.189
Even here, in the luckiest place
in the universe,

01:16:04.273 --> 01:16:07.484
I still found a way to screw it all up.

01:16:07.568 --> 01:16:10.404
[sighs] And that's how I know.

01:16:10.487 --> 01:16:11.822
Know what?

01:16:11.905 --> 01:16:17.452
That it's not my bad luck
that's the problem. It's just me.

01:16:19.329 --> 01:16:22.541
And there's no amount of good luck
that can ever fix it.

01:16:22.624 --> 01:16:24.501
I don't believe that.

01:16:24.585 --> 01:16:26.128
Well you should.

01:16:26.211 --> 01:16:29.464
Not only did I doom Hazel, and you, and--

01:16:29.548 --> 01:16:33.927
and everyone else to a life of bad luck,
but now I can't get back to her.

01:16:34.469 --> 01:16:37.306
I'm just another adult
who broke another promise.

01:16:37.931 --> 01:16:40.851
The kind that leaves and doesn't stick.

01:16:41.810 --> 01:16:46.190
I swear,
she'd be better off if she never met me.

01:16:48.734 --> 01:16:50.444
Well, I wouldn't be better off.

01:16:51.153 --> 01:16:52.779
You're not bad, Sam.

01:16:53.697 --> 01:16:55.282
You're the opposite of bad,

01:16:55.866 --> 01:17:00.245
like some kind of pure goodness
I didn't think was possible for a human.

01:17:00.829 --> 01:17:05.250
Your first instinct is to share,
like the tasty meat bread.

01:17:05.334 --> 01:17:09.505
Or to help, even if helping might stop you
from getting what you want the most.

01:17:09.588 --> 01:17:14.551
And what's crazier is what you want
the most isn't even for you.

01:17:15.219 --> 01:17:18.639
You want good things for others in a way
that I can't comprehend,

01:17:18.722 --> 01:17:22.476
and you'll endure the worst bad luck ever
to make it happen.

01:17:24.144 --> 01:17:28.190
I was wrong to ever tell you not
to try because every time you do,

01:17:28.273 --> 01:17:31.693
you make things better.
And that's how I know.

01:17:32.778 --> 01:17:34.404
Know what?

01:17:34.488 --> 01:17:37.783
That your friend Hazel
doesn't need good luck.

01:17:37.866 --> 01:17:41.620
She's already the luckiest girl
in the world 'cause she has you.

01:17:43.288 --> 01:17:46.291
You said you wanted
to do something good with your life.

01:17:47.376 --> 01:17:48.919
You already have.

01:17:51.547 --> 01:17:53.632
[crying]

01:17:56.844 --> 01:17:58.637
[whimpers]

01:18:03.308 --> 01:18:05.310
I didn't mean to make you cry.

01:18:06.186 --> 01:18:09.273
Don't worry, Bob. It's a happy cry.

01:18:10.148 --> 01:18:13.569
Humans are so weird.

01:18:13.652 --> 01:18:15.988
[laughs]

01:18:16.947 --> 01:18:18.782
[inhales deeply, sighs]

01:18:19.366 --> 01:18:21.410
There's gotta be a way to fix this!

01:18:21.493 --> 01:18:23.954
Yes, and get you back to Hazel.

01:18:24.037 --> 01:18:26.790
[inhales sharply]
But fat chance of that happening.

01:18:26.874 --> 01:18:29.418
Unless you have some good luck hidden
in there, which, uh--

01:18:29.501 --> 01:18:31.128
Wait. What did you say?

01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:34.089
"Unless you have some good luck hidden
in there"?

01:18:34.173 --> 01:18:36.091
-That's it.
-What is?

01:18:36.175 --> 01:18:38.135
There's good luck down in Bad Luck.

01:18:38.218 --> 01:18:39.845
How do you know that?

01:18:39.928 --> 01:18:41.221
Because I've seen it!

01:18:41.305 --> 01:18:45.017
And you're planning to go right back
down to Bad Luck and fetch it?

01:18:45.601 --> 01:18:47.811
-That's your plan?
-Bingo.

01:18:51.231 --> 01:18:53.108
-[grunts]
-Welcome back to the Land of Bad Luck.

01:18:53.192 --> 01:18:55.235
Oh, it's like I never left.

01:18:56.111 --> 01:18:57.112
[groans]

01:18:57.196 --> 01:19:01.325
The good luck is somewhere
between here in Dog Poop and the elevator.

01:19:01.825 --> 01:19:03.994
Okay, describe what you saw exactly.

01:19:04.077 --> 01:19:07.873
Monsters were gathered around
this green light that had to be good luck.

01:19:07.956 --> 01:19:09.291
And then a bell would ding,

01:19:09.374 --> 01:19:11.919
and they'd start shouting,
and there was fire and--

01:19:12.002 --> 01:19:14.087
-Fire?
-Yeah.

01:19:14.171 --> 01:19:16.215
It could only be one place.

01:19:19.885 --> 01:19:22.304
I must have come
in the back door last time.

01:19:22.930 --> 01:19:24.306
[door thuds, creaks]

01:19:24.973 --> 01:19:26.683
Wait! Don't go in yet!

01:19:26.767 --> 01:19:28.560
[monsters chattering]

01:19:31.021 --> 01:19:32.105
Bob.

01:19:32.189 --> 01:19:35.192
-[gasps]
-[monsters growling]

01:19:35.275 --> 01:19:36.610
[gasps, whimpers]

01:19:36.693 --> 01:19:37.736
-Hi.
-[screams]

01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:44.535
Oh, this is it.

01:19:47.079 --> 01:19:49.665
Bob? Oh, is that you?

01:19:49.748 --> 01:19:51.792
Where the heck you been, brother?

01:19:51.875 --> 01:19:53.710
Hey, Rootie, how's it going?

01:19:53.794 --> 01:19:56.129
-[patron 1] It's Bob.
-[patron 2] Long time, no see.

01:19:56.213 --> 01:19:59.258
-Monsters, huh?
-You said monsters.

01:19:59.341 --> 01:20:02.427
I said roots and goblins, which they are.

01:20:02.511 --> 01:20:03.720
[bleating] Hey, Bob.

01:20:04.388 --> 01:20:06.723
-Oh, and goats.
-How do they know you?

01:20:06.807 --> 01:20:09.393
Oh, I, uh, spent a couple of hours here.

01:20:09.476 --> 01:20:11.562
Yeah, try eight lifetimes.

01:20:11.645 --> 01:20:15.315
Just sitting here sipping
my famous tangerine tornado

01:20:15.399 --> 01:20:18.652
and talking about how if he could
just find a little good luck,

01:20:18.735 --> 01:20:20.362
he could finally be happy.

01:20:20.445 --> 01:20:22.322
Oh, we thought you were dead, Bob.

01:20:22.406 --> 01:20:25.367
Yeah, Rootie even retired your barstool.

01:20:25.450 --> 01:20:28.829
Wow, that's-- Thanks.

01:20:28.912 --> 01:20:31.290
But, uh, yeah, not dead. [chuckles]

01:20:31.373 --> 01:20:34.209
Just looking for a little good luck,
like Rootie said.

01:20:34.293 --> 01:20:36.128
Aw, where are my manners?

01:20:36.211 --> 01:20:39.381
I'm Rootie, the proprietor
of this tropical juice bar

01:20:39.464 --> 01:20:42.676
and the self-appointed mayor of Bad Luck.

01:20:42.759 --> 01:20:44.136
[imitates trumpet]

01:20:44.219 --> 01:20:46.388
Nice to meet you, Rootie. I'm Sam.

01:20:46.471 --> 01:20:49.892
Hey, you're that leprechaun
who broke the elevator.

01:20:49.975 --> 01:20:52.811
Human actually, and yeah.
Sorry about that.

01:20:52.895 --> 01:20:55.898
Human, huh? Well, that's a first.

01:20:55.981 --> 01:20:58.650
Hey, Bob.
We'll get your stool down for ya.

01:20:58.734 --> 01:21:00.402
[grunting]

01:21:00.485 --> 01:21:03.155
-[patrons exclaim]
-[exclaims] Duct tape, flying in!

01:21:03.906 --> 01:21:06.533
Oh, don't worry about it, guys.
We-- We can't stick around.

01:21:06.617 --> 01:21:09.077
-We need your help.
-Name it. What's going on?

01:21:09.161 --> 01:21:12.247
Well, the luck lines have detached,
the Randomizer is broken,

01:21:12.331 --> 01:21:15.250
and we're floating off into the void
with no real purpose to exist.

01:21:15.334 --> 01:21:17.586
We thought we just short-circuited a wire.

01:21:17.669 --> 01:21:19.963
We didn't realize we had broken
the whole world.

01:21:20.047 --> 01:21:21.798
Oh, it wasn't you guys. It was us.

01:21:21.882 --> 01:21:25.010
Something broke, and it wasn't our fault?
Amen, brother.

01:21:25.093 --> 01:21:26.470
[both cheer, laugh]

01:21:26.553 --> 01:21:28.180
But there might still be a way to fix it.

01:21:28.263 --> 01:21:30.724
When I was here before,
I saw a green light,

01:21:30.807 --> 01:21:33.185
which I'm really hoping is good luck.

01:21:33.268 --> 01:21:36.355
Oh, yeah, we've got some.
It's in the Lucky Shot.

01:21:37.022 --> 01:21:38.023
[both] Lucky Shot?

01:21:38.106 --> 01:21:40.067
-[chattering]
-[ball dribbling]

01:21:41.026 --> 01:21:42.986
-[grunting]
-[all exclaiming]

01:21:44.696 --> 01:21:46.073
-[cheering]
-[bell dings]

01:21:46.156 --> 01:21:48.408
-[Rootie] Yeah! Way to go, Stinky!
-[chanting]

01:21:48.909 --> 01:21:50.327
All right, follow me.

01:21:52.371 --> 01:21:53.747
Happened after you left, Bob.

01:21:53.830 --> 01:21:57.167
I was out fixing cracks
when I backed into this pipe

01:21:57.251 --> 01:21:59.211
and a little good luck floated out.

01:21:59.878 --> 01:22:03.966
So I gathered it up and dropped it
straight into the Lucky Shot.

01:22:04.049 --> 01:22:07.052
Figured that way everybody
could experience a little good luck.

01:22:07.135 --> 01:22:09.429
-You know what I mean?
-But what about them?

01:22:09.513 --> 01:22:10.639
Oh, you're kidding?

01:22:10.722 --> 01:22:13.892
[chuckles] They'll just find
something else to rally around.

01:22:13.976 --> 01:22:17.062
It's one of the benefits of bad luck.
It teaches you to pivot.

01:22:17.145 --> 01:22:19.439
I never really thought about it that way.

01:22:20.774 --> 01:22:23.360
[all grumbling]

01:22:23.443 --> 01:22:25.946
-[patron 1] Come on!
-[patron 2] Something must be broken.

01:22:26.029 --> 01:22:27.573
-[patron 3] Bummer.
-Huh.

01:22:28.532 --> 01:22:30.868
Okay. Frisbee golf, anyone?

01:22:30.951 --> 01:22:32.327
See what I'm saying?

01:22:32.411 --> 01:22:34.246
And once you've fixed the Randomizer,

01:22:34.329 --> 01:22:37.165
I have no doubt, one day,
I'll find some more.

01:22:37.791 --> 01:22:41.378
Thank you, Rootie.
Oh, and we'll need some bad luck dust too.

01:22:41.461 --> 01:22:43.755
Oh, have at it. Plenty of that around.

01:22:43.839 --> 01:22:46.550
And if you could use our help up there,
just say the word.

01:22:46.633 --> 01:22:47.676
Word.

01:22:47.759 --> 01:22:49.553
[chuckling] Well, giddy up!

01:22:49.636 --> 01:22:51.638
We gotta get this to the Dragon.

01:22:51.722 --> 01:22:55.392
She won't be happy to see us.
We just wrecked her world.

01:22:56.310 --> 01:22:59.229
I think we know someone
she will be happy to see.

01:22:59.813 --> 01:23:03.358
[Babe cries, blows nose]

01:23:03.442 --> 01:23:04.443
[cries]

01:23:07.196 --> 01:23:10.032
How could I miss that she was a human?

01:23:10.115 --> 01:23:12.993
Oh, a tall leprechaun? Ha!

01:23:13.076 --> 01:23:15.037
How dare they show up here?

01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:16.580
[Babe] Who is it?

01:23:16.663 --> 01:23:20.375
It's Bob, the girl and a unicorn.

01:23:20.459 --> 01:23:21.668
Jeff?

01:23:22.419 --> 01:23:27.841
[grunting, sighing] Guter Kummer,
I don't remember it being that tough.

01:23:27.925 --> 01:23:30.093
Of course, last time I was a stallion.

01:23:30.177 --> 01:23:32.554
It has been a hundred years.

01:23:34.097 --> 01:23:37.809
[blusters] Schön dich zu sehen, Babe.

01:23:37.893 --> 01:23:39.561
Heimdall.

01:23:40.354 --> 01:23:42.856
[sighs] You got a lot of nerve
coming here.

01:23:42.940 --> 01:23:44.608
Hear them out, Babe.

01:23:44.691 --> 01:23:48.529
A little good luck.
It might be enough to fix the Randomizer.

01:23:48.612 --> 01:23:49.780
Where did it come from?

01:23:49.863 --> 01:23:51.114
Bad Luck.

01:23:51.198 --> 01:23:55.369
Somehow it made its way down there,
and they were kind enough to share.

01:23:55.452 --> 01:23:58.080
We need you to forge two new stones.

01:23:58.163 --> 01:23:59.831
Just like when you made this.

01:24:00.541 --> 01:24:03.085
[gasps] You still have it.

01:24:03.168 --> 01:24:04.628
I never took it off.

01:24:05.295 --> 01:24:06.755
[puffs]

01:24:06.839 --> 01:24:10.092
Your ancient dragon flames
have the power, Babe.

01:24:10.175 --> 01:24:12.928
I trust you remember how
to wield your burning hot Feuer?

01:24:13.011 --> 01:24:14.930
Was that a dare?

01:24:15.013 --> 01:24:16.849
[whinnies]

01:24:22.229 --> 01:24:24.439
Let's see if I've still got it.

01:24:28.819 --> 01:24:30.612
[inhales sharply]

01:24:43.083 --> 01:24:45.043
[stammering] Was ist das?

01:24:45.127 --> 01:24:47.588
You said you needed two stones. Voilà!

01:24:47.671 --> 01:24:49.548
But you made three.

01:24:49.631 --> 01:24:51.675
Oh, the bad luck stone was just a warm-up.

01:24:51.758 --> 01:24:54.845
And these are for the Randomizer.

01:24:54.928 --> 01:24:57.431
Have you lost your brain marbles, Babe?

01:24:57.514 --> 01:25:00.559
Because you know very well
that das Randomizer needs a good luck

01:25:00.642 --> 01:25:02.019
and a bad luck stone.

01:25:02.102 --> 01:25:05.522
Does it though? Two stones, sure.

01:25:05.606 --> 01:25:07.941
But show me where it says
they can't both be lucky.

01:25:08.734 --> 01:25:11.236
This is the moment
we've all been waiting for.

01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:15.157
[gasps] With these two stones,
we can eliminate bad luck

01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:19.161
and all that goes with it.
The frustration, the loneliness, the--

01:25:19.244 --> 01:25:21.747
-Wait. But--
-You said it yourself, Sam.

01:25:21.830 --> 01:25:25.209
Without bad luck,
your world could look just like ours.

01:25:26.418 --> 01:25:27.961
Toodle-oo!

01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:47.022
[whirring]

01:25:54.279 --> 01:25:55.614
Down to go up.

01:26:09.628 --> 01:26:11.046
[pants]

01:26:11.129 --> 01:26:12.130
[pants]

01:26:12.214 --> 01:26:14.675
I can't let you
place two good luck stones.

01:26:14.758 --> 01:26:18.595
Nonsense.
Good luck for everyone all the time.

01:26:18.679 --> 01:26:21.056
We can make that happen, Sam.

01:26:21.139 --> 01:26:23.642
You, of all people, should want that.

01:26:23.725 --> 01:26:27.563
I know bad luck can be terrible,
especially when it keeps coming.

01:26:27.646 --> 01:26:31.024
-But we still need it.
-[scoffs] Need it?

01:26:31.108 --> 01:26:35.028
The only thing bad luck ever did for me
was break my world and break my heart.

01:26:35.612 --> 01:26:37.948
No. It was me who broke your world.

01:26:39.449 --> 01:26:43.036
It's Bad Luck that's here
helping put it back together.

01:26:43.871 --> 01:26:46.498
-Hey, these things happen.
-Not here.

01:26:46.582 --> 01:26:49.042
-Oh, there we go.
-Don't worry.

01:26:54.298 --> 01:26:57.009
I know you're afraid to let bad luck in.

01:26:57.092 --> 01:27:00.888
You think it's the reason you're alone.
I did too.

01:27:00.971 --> 01:27:04.433
I blamed bad luck for everything
that went wrong in my life.

01:27:04.516 --> 01:27:09.605
But coming here, I realized that
it also made some things go very right.

01:27:09.688 --> 01:27:14.067
Without my bad luck,
I wouldn't have met Hazel or Bob.

01:27:15.819 --> 01:27:18.822
And you would've never met
the love of your life.

01:27:18.906 --> 01:27:20.199
What are you talking about?

01:27:20.282 --> 01:27:23.994
You only met Jeff
because he'd been doused by bad luck.

01:27:24.077 --> 01:27:26.205
Which means, it didn't tear you apart.

01:27:26.288 --> 01:27:28.749
Bad luck brought you together
in the first place.

01:27:30.792 --> 01:27:33.170
You think your creatures
can't endure bad luck,

01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:37.257
but they can, and they will.

01:27:46.892 --> 01:27:48.435
And so can you.

01:27:48.519 --> 01:27:52.648
You don't have to fear bad luck
because you have each other.

01:27:54.358 --> 01:27:57.569
And that makes you
the luckiest creatures I know.

01:28:01.949 --> 01:28:05.953
Why, if-- if good and bad luck can
at long last live side by side,

01:28:06.954 --> 01:28:08.830
then I would love nothing more.

01:28:09.831 --> 01:28:12.668
Far be it from me
to take all the mystery out of life.

01:28:12.751 --> 01:28:14.461
Both it is.

01:28:20.801 --> 01:28:22.344
[screams]

01:28:22.427 --> 01:28:23.262
Sam!

01:28:26.390 --> 01:28:28.100
[grunts]

01:28:31.854 --> 01:28:32.855
[whirs]

01:28:32.938 --> 01:28:34.815
[cheering]

01:28:35.524 --> 01:28:36.525
[Sam yelps]

01:28:45.576 --> 01:28:49.454
We lucky ladies of stature
oughta stick together, don't you think?

01:28:49.538 --> 01:28:50.581
Oh, yes.

01:28:56.503 --> 01:28:57.713
Thank you, Sam.

01:28:59.047 --> 01:29:02.050
[whirring]

01:29:06.930 --> 01:29:08.390
[gasping]

01:29:11.727 --> 01:29:13.937
[exclaims, cheers]

01:29:16.023 --> 01:29:17.274
[chuckles]

01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:02.444
[chimes]

01:30:28.887 --> 01:30:32.474
[Rootie] All right!
One bad-break banana banshee coming down.

01:30:34.059 --> 01:30:35.936
-[chuckles] Sorry, Root.
-[glass shatters]

01:30:36.019 --> 01:30:40.482
No problem, Fred.
You know I always make two, just in case.

01:30:40.566 --> 01:30:42.150
-[banging]
-[bleating] What was that?

01:30:42.234 --> 01:30:43.861
[door thuds, creaks]

01:30:46.238 --> 01:30:47.489
Knock, knock.

01:30:47.573 --> 01:30:49.741
[creatures exclaiming]

01:30:49.825 --> 01:30:51.618
We miss you already.

01:30:51.702 --> 01:30:53.537
-"We"?
-[patron 4] Sam!

01:30:53.620 --> 01:30:56.790
-[laughs] Sam. Bob.
-Hey, Rootie.

01:30:56.874 --> 01:30:59.251
-[Rootie] Good Luck in Bad Luck.
-Oh, and Hairy Lemon.

01:30:59.334 --> 01:31:02.087
Now, this is a good-looking juice bar.

01:31:02.171 --> 01:31:05.340
[chuckles] Yeah. First tropical juice bar
in the Land of Luck.

01:31:05.424 --> 01:31:09.178
We come bearing gifts.
Or, well, gift rather.

01:31:09.261 --> 01:31:10.971
It's for the Lucky Shot.

01:31:11.054 --> 01:31:12.639
[patrons gasping]

01:31:12.723 --> 01:31:15.309
She sure is a beauty.

01:31:15.392 --> 01:31:18.770
Oh, it's a small token of thanks
for coming to our aid.

01:31:18.854 --> 01:31:20.772
It was our pleasure, Ms. The Dragon.

01:31:20.856 --> 01:31:23.817
And we sure do appreciate you dropping
in for a visit.

01:31:23.901 --> 01:31:25.986
I should have come long ago.

01:31:26.069 --> 01:31:30.908
Und we have our unlucky Freund Sam
to thank for bringing us all together.

01:31:30.991 --> 01:31:32.492
Way to go, Latvia!

01:31:32.576 --> 01:31:35.287
[both chanting] Latvia! Latvia!

01:31:35.370 --> 01:31:38.248
[all chanting] Sam! Sam! Sam! Sam!

01:31:38.332 --> 01:31:40.125
Speaking of my bad luck,

01:31:40.209 --> 01:31:44.588
I'd like to thank you guys
for sending it all my way.

01:31:44.671 --> 01:31:49.635
The flat tires, the toast jam-side-down,
the keys in the sewer.

01:31:49.718 --> 01:31:52.137
-Hey, that was me!
-[laughing]

01:31:52.221 --> 01:31:58.310
It wasn't all fun,
but I wouldn't change a single thing.

01:31:58.894 --> 01:32:01.438
Fire her up. What do you say, Sam?

01:32:02.523 --> 01:32:06.860
[patrons gasping, cheering]

01:32:06.944 --> 01:32:09.821
-Take a shot, Bob.
-[patron 5] Come on, Bob!

01:32:09.905 --> 01:32:12.699
[patrons laughing, gasping]

01:32:14.576 --> 01:32:16.703
-[all cheering]
-[bell dinging]

01:32:16.787 --> 01:32:18.956
[chanting, cheering]

01:32:19.540 --> 01:32:23.418
Hey! So, what do you say, Bob?
Ready to come home?

01:32:23.502 --> 01:32:25.587
Sounds like the guys
got your barstool fixed

01:32:25.671 --> 01:32:27.506
and ready for your little cat butt.

01:32:27.589 --> 01:32:29.466
[chuckles] Thanks, guys.

01:32:29.550 --> 01:32:32.135
Well, we were actually hoping
Bob might stay in Good Luck.

01:32:32.219 --> 01:32:33.804
The Captain said
you could have your job back.

01:32:33.887 --> 01:32:39.101
Yeah, despite your growing rap sheet,
Gerry claims you're a good line cat.

01:32:39.184 --> 01:32:40.811
So, come on back.

01:32:40.894 --> 01:32:45.190
Oh, and we made you this,
your very own lucky penny.

01:32:46.108 --> 01:32:47.109
Wow.

01:32:47.860 --> 01:32:51.280
A lucky life
just like you always wanted, Bob.

01:32:51.363 --> 01:32:52.656
I'm so happy for you.

01:32:54.116 --> 01:32:55.659
Good for you, Bob.

01:32:57.494 --> 01:33:00.914
Thanks, Captain, but, uh, I can't accept.

01:33:00.998 --> 01:33:02.916
-Boss?
-Bob?

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.127
You're all better friends than I deserve.

01:33:05.210 --> 01:33:08.005
-Oh, well, that's true.
-[all laughing]

01:33:08.088 --> 01:33:12.134
Especially you, Gerry.
And friends we will stay.

01:33:12.801 --> 01:33:16.263
But as for where I live out
the rest of my days--

01:33:17.431 --> 01:33:21.768
If I can, I'd like to spend them with Sam,
in her world.

01:33:21.852 --> 01:33:22.853
[inhales sharply]

01:33:25.564 --> 01:33:27.983
Be your forever family?

01:33:29.818 --> 01:33:33.530
Me and you, a forever family?

01:33:34.865 --> 01:33:36.116
I'd really love that.

01:33:38.410 --> 01:33:39.995
[patrons] Aw.

01:33:45.167 --> 01:33:47.836
You realize you're hugging me, right?

01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:51.131
Yes. And you better get used to it.

01:33:51.215 --> 01:33:53.008
Juice drinks on the house!

01:33:53.091 --> 01:33:54.468
[patrons cheering]

01:33:56.136 --> 01:34:00.974
Yes, ma'am. Heat it up.
We're gonna call that the Lucky Dragon.

01:34:07.314 --> 01:34:10.526
Mini palm tree. Some bulk beans.

01:34:10.609 --> 01:34:12.027
Oh, I'm making bean bags,

01:34:12.110 --> 01:34:15.113
and I thought a mix might be nice,
you know, in your hand.

01:34:16.156 --> 01:34:21.370
And one soap-on-a-rope
brings your total to $13.57.

01:34:21.453 --> 01:34:24.248
Let me just find my credit card.

01:34:25.916 --> 01:34:28.252
-Oh, found my card!
-[gasps] Great.

01:34:28.877 --> 01:34:30.420
Here you go, Ms. Charles.

01:34:30.504 --> 01:34:31.505
Oh. [chuckles]

01:34:31.588 --> 01:34:33.966
Hey, I got this,
Sam the manager. [chuckles]

01:34:34.049 --> 01:34:35.175
Bless you, Marvin.

01:34:36.593 --> 01:34:39.137
-Have a great time!
-See you Monday!

01:34:39.221 --> 01:34:41.014
I should never
have gotten you a cell phone.

01:34:41.098 --> 01:34:44.768
I can't stop. I'm sorry. I have a problem.
I was born to thumb-type.

01:34:44.852 --> 01:34:47.145
Map says nine minutes,
but we'll take the shortcut.

01:34:55.112 --> 01:34:56.530
[doorbell rings]

01:34:56.613 --> 01:34:57.948
They're here!

01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:04.246
Sam!

01:35:06.832 --> 01:35:09.918
-Come here, Bob.
-I say, Hazel. This is a tight one.

01:35:10.002 --> 01:35:12.504
Hi, Sam. Hi, Bob.

01:35:12.588 --> 01:35:14.131
[dog barks, pants]

01:35:14.214 --> 01:35:15.716
Ah, ah. Sit.

01:35:15.799 --> 01:35:18.302
Good work, Bingo. Who's your master?

01:35:18.385 --> 01:35:23.891
Who's your master? That's right.
Bob is. Bob is your master.

01:35:23.974 --> 01:35:24.975
[barks]

01:35:25.058 --> 01:35:27.060
Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad.

01:35:28.061 --> 01:35:29.897
She's just a little excited.

01:35:29.980 --> 01:35:31.231
Yeah, me too.

01:35:31.315 --> 01:35:33.609
Hazel's really lucky she found you guys.

01:35:33.692 --> 01:35:35.652
I'm pretty sure we're the lucky ones.

01:35:37.029 --> 01:35:40.532
Oh, and we'll see you here
for dinner on Sunday! Five o'clock.

01:35:40.616 --> 01:35:42.284
We're having Bob's favorite.

01:35:42.367 --> 01:35:43.410
We'll be here.

01:35:43.493 --> 01:35:45.787
You hear that, Bob? Paninis on Sunday.

01:35:45.871 --> 01:35:47.998
Tasty meat bread.

01:35:48.081 --> 01:35:49.291
-Bingo.
-[Bingo barks]

01:35:49.374 --> 01:35:50.375
Not you!

01:35:55.464 --> 01:35:58.217
[Sam] My new life is nothing
like the one I pictured.

01:35:59.092 --> 01:36:00.177
It's better.

01:36:02.304 --> 01:36:05.474
Things don't always go as planned,
of course.

01:36:05.557 --> 01:36:08.560
Unless, well, you plan for them.

01:36:17.486 --> 01:36:22.282
In the end, you might say that bad luck
led me to the luckiest thing in the world.

01:36:22.950 --> 01:36:24.785
Or was it good luck?

01:36:25.369 --> 01:36:28.664
Whatever it was,
I found my forever family.

01:36:29.373 --> 01:36:32.668
The kind that doesn't leave. They stick.

01:36:32.751 --> 01:36:36.213
And I'd do it all over again to get here.
